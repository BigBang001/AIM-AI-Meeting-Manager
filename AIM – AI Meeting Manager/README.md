# AIM: AI Meeting Manager

**AIM** is a terminal and web-based AI meeting assistant that helps you manage meeting prompts, automatically generates professional AI responses, and maintains a context-aware memory of conversations. It simulates real AI behavior with token-limited memory, undo/redo features, and a recap of finalized discussions.

## Features

### Terminal Mode

* Add meeting prompts and receive automated AI suggestions.
* Undo the last AI response.
* Finalize prompts to lock their responses.
* View the full history of prompt-response pairs.
* Context-aware token memory: older prompts are automatically removed when the token limit is exceeded.

### Web App Mode

* Modern, responsive UI with dark/light theme toggle (sun/moon icon).
* Context memory bar showing token usage.
* Sections for **Active**, **Finalized**, and **Pinned** prompts.

## Testing

Run unit tests to validate context manager behavior:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

Test scenarios include:

* Adding prompts and automatic AI responses.
* Undoing the latest AI response.
* Finalizing prompts.
* Token-based context limit enforcement.
* Edge cases like empty memory or empty undo stack.

---

## Notes

* Token counting is based on **words**, mimicking real AI context limitations.
* Undo removes the latest AI response and may remove the prompt if no responses remain.
* Finalized prompts are locked and cannot be undone.
* Pinned prompts are protected from automatic removal.

---

## Future Enhancements

* Multi-user support with separate context queues.
* AI learning from user input for better suggestions.
* Integration with Google Calendar or meeting platforms.
* Improved UI with real-time animations and notifications.
